# Marketing Channel Performance Dashboard
This repository contains a self-initiated business intelligence project that visualizes key metrics for marketing channel performance. I designed this dashboard to sharpen my skills in data analytics and storytelling, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to build a comprehensive dashboard that helps answer critical questions about which marketing channels are driving the best results. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) and Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) to evaluate channel efficiency and effectiveness.

## Key Outcomes
KPIs at a Glance: The dashboard provides a high-level overview with clear key performance indicators (KPIs) for Total Marketing Cost, Average ROAS, Average CPA, Total Revenue, and Total Units Sold.

-Channel Comparisons: Visualizations compare channels on various metrics, revealing which channels are the most profitable (high ROAS) and most cost-effective (low CPA).
-Actionable Insights: Discovered that certain channels, despite a high total cost, delivered a superior ROAS, highlighting them as prime candidates for increased budget allocation.

## Technical Skills & Tools
-Power BI: Used for the entire project, including data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.
-DAX: Developed custom measures for key metrics like ROAS and CPA, creating a dynamic and interactive analysis.
